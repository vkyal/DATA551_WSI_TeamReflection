### Reflection - Milestone 4

#### Dashboard Overview:

As a data scientist consultancy firm our goal for the project is to create a dashboard for the citizen or the population who wants to get idea of the World Sustaiabiity with respect to Social, Economic and Environmental indicators. The dashboard is to show the World Sustainability to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In other words, it is about finding a way to achieve economic, social, and environmental progress in a way that is sustainable over the long term. World Sustainability Dashboard is created to track the performance of 173 countries against a range of sustainability metrics over a 19-year period (From 2000 to 2018).

#### For the fourth milestone, we have done the following 5 tabs out of 5. 

World Tab: The first tab is showing the World Sustainability index(WSI) of all the countries. Its an interactive world map which shows the WSI when we hover the mouse over it.

Environmental Tab: The second tab is showing two graphs of environmental data. One graph is showing what proportion of the population is using the internet, given they have access to electricity. And the other graph is showing the proportion of adjusted savings: CO2 damage for given CO2 emission from production annually.

Social Tab: The third tab is showing social graphs. First graph is showing the literacy level of the selected country for the selected period. The second graph is showing the disparity between the employment of males and females for the selected country, year, and period.

Economic Tab: The fourth tab is showing barplots of the Trade % of GPD per capita from 2000 to 2018 for the required country. It has legends for Imports and Exports.

Summary Tab: The fifth tab is showing two graphs, one bubble chart for the inflation v/s GDP and other is how income classification is divided for the given country. The second is the pie chart showing the proportion of countries according to the income classification for a particular year. In this tab Income classification is multi-select whereas year is dropdown.

#### Development and bug for milestone 4

While we were putting together the dashboard for the milestone 4, we faced the following issues:

1. Had difficulty to format layouts as per the initial planning but with few attempts we achieved what we wanted.


#### Suggestion from TA from Milestone 1,2 & 3

1. For Environmental and Social tab we have implemented the graph side by side and moved the drop-down options at the top.
2. The graph size is increased as suggested in previous milestone along with width and height.
3. We have concentrated more on beautifying the dash to resolve the scaling issues and other styling effects.

#### Thoughts on the feedback from TA and peers.

Following are the thoughts on the feedback to make dashboard more user-friendly and effective:

- The app is very user friendly and the graphs are interactive.
- We worked on all the suggestion from milestone 1 and 2 which was implemented in milestone 3 and got a good review from the TA and peers.
- The most valuable feedback we got is from our TA which was the placement of graphs in the dashboard and scaling.
