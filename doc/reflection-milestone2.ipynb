    "As a data scientist consultancy firm our goal for the project is to create a dashboard for the citizen or the population who wants to get idea of the World Sustaiabiity with respect to Social, Economic and Environmental indicators. The dashboard is to show the World Sustainability to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In other words, it is about finding a way to achieve economic, social, and environmental progress in a way that is sustainable over the long term.\n",

The 1st page shows the sustainability index of all the countries and when hovering over a map it will show the index value of that specific country.\n",

    "2. Environmental Tab: The second tab is showing two graphs of environmental data. One graph is showing what proportion of the population is using the internet, given they have access to electricity. And the other graph is showing the proportion of adjusted savings: CO2 damage for given CO2 emission from production annually.\n",

    "3. Social Tab: The third tab is showing social graphs. One graph is showing the literacy level of the selected country for the selected period. The second graph is showing the disparity between the employment of males and females for the selected country, year, and period."

By default for this chart, it shows for all countries and for the year 2018. For the pie-chart distribution of income classes are shown based on the selected country, year and income group."
