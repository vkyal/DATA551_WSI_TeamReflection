Team "Group 7" Work Contract

How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?

Each of the 4 members will be responsible for one-fourth half of the workload. 
This will be divided by Milestones, with Ujjwal, Nowshaba taking the R version 
and Shveta, Varshita taking the Python version.

What are the expected work hours for the project?

Project goals are task-based, not hours-based. As a result, the work hours required are only those required to finish your portion of the project.

How often will group meetings occur?

Once a week during Lab, and as needed.

What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?

Work to the best of your ability (and time constraints).

Other thoughts!

All written communication will occur through Slack.
